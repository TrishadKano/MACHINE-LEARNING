## Data Science Internship Projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science internship program. The projects focus on hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation. Each project is designed to help me gain practical skills in key areas of Data Science.
