## Data Science Internship Projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science internship program. The projects focus on hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation. Each project is designed to help me gain practical skills in key areas of Data Science.

Project List
Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Public Dataset
Description
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset Titanic dataset from Kaggle).

Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and conducted basic statistical analysis.

Visualized data distributions, correlations, and key patterns using charts and graphs.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
Titanic Dataset

Files
EDA_Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.


Project 2: Simple Linear Regression on Housing Prices
Description
Used a housing prices dataset (Boston Housing dataset).

Performed data preprocessing, including feature selection and normalization.

Built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, square footage, etc.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
Boston Housing Dataset

Files
Linear_Regression_Housing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.


Project 3: Loan Eligibility Prediction
Description
Loaded and explored a loan dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable (Loan Status: Approved/Not Approved).

Developed a Loan Eligibility Prediction model using Python.

Learned and applied popular Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).

Explored various Python libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Tools Used
